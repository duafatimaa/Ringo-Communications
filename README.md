# Ringo-Communications
Ringo Communications is a communication tool integrated into Microsoft Teams that allows teams to communicate with external parties through text messaging and WhatsApp. To use Ringo, team members must first be added to the new Communications team.

Once added, team members can interact with Ringo by doing an @Ringo mention followed by a comma and their message. For example, "@Ringo, please send the client information about our new product." After hitting enter, team members must then await a reply from the external party.

To reply to incoming messages, team members can go to the Communications Team, select the desired channel, and then look for incoming messages from people. To reply, they can hit "Reply," type @Ringo followed by a comma and their message, and hit enter to send.

It's important to note that this process has been designed specifically for Ringo Communications and may vary for other communication tools or platforms. It's also possible that this process may have been customized or adjusted by your organization to fit their specific needs.
